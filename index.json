[{"categories":["Templates"],"content":"Fastai is a deep learning library built with Pytorch for rapidly building neural networks. For image classification problems, I start with fastai to get a feel of the problem and set some realistic expectations. This template acts as the first iteration of a solution. Customization and enhancements are done on top of this code to suit a problem statement.
