[{"categories":["projects"],"content":"From May 1st, the government of India has opened several vaccination centers for people aged between 18 to 45. The vaccines are scarce and logging into Cowin app to check status is cumbersome due to frequent timeouts. The government has also made a public API to access vaccine related information like finding availability and downloading vaccination certificates. Using this, I have made a dashboard that makes it easy to find vaccine availability by district or pincode. Info It can only view vaccine availability. The actual booking needs to be done by the Cowin app ","date":"2021-05-15","objectID":"/covid-india-vaccine-appointment-availability/:0:0","tags":["javascript","web-development","python","angular"],"title":"Covid Vaccine Availability Dashboard","uri":"/covid-india-vaccine-appointment-availability/"},{"categories":["projects"],"content":"Dashboard Demo This dashboard is made with Angular web framework and Angular Material for components.
