They are like pre-made blueprints that can be customized to solve a recurring design problem in any code.
All patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.
Creational Patterns This pattern provides ways to create object creation in a manner that increases flexibility and reuse of code.
Factory Method This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.</description></item><item><title>Solid Design Principles</title><link>https://pratyakshajha.me/solid-design-principles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 12:37:56 +0530</pubDate><author>Pratyaksha Jha</author><guid>https://pratyakshajha.me/solid-design-principles/</guid><description>SOLID is a set design principles in object-oriented context to make maintainable, testable and extendable software.
Single Responsibility A class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
Benefits:
Testing: A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases. Lower coupling: Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies. Organization: Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic ones. Example Bad A class representing a book:</description></item></channel></rss>
