The vaccines are scarce and logging into Cowin app to check status is cumbersome due to frequent timeouts. The government has also made a public API to access vaccine related information like finding availability and downloading vaccination certificates. Using this, I have made a dashboard that makes it easy to find vaccine availability by district or pincode.</description></item></channel></rss>
